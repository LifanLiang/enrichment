## Real P values
I obtained count matrix and related R code for analysis from Lexi. The differential accessibility result for NEFM_pos_glut 0hr vs. 1hr was reproduced. I drew QQ plot to compare p values with the theorectical uniform distribution (basically the quantiles). The test method is "MAST". Considering the time for computation, I only compute p values with chr11. Shown below is the log-log QQ plot.

The next figure is the QQ plot without the log scale.

### Permutation of p values

I randomly shuffled the labels (0hr and 1hr) of the cells and perform differential analysis with the same parameter settings.
